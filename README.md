# Object Tracking and Validation with YOLOv8 and CNN

This project combines real-time object tracking using YOLOv8 with the training of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the tracked objects. The pipeline involves persisting object tracks, saving cropped objects, training a CNN model, and utilizing the trained model for remote object validation.

## Key Features

- **YOLOv8 Object Tracking:** Utilize YOLOv8 for real-time object tracking, providing bounding box visualization and track persistence.
  
- **CNN Model Training:** Save cropped objects from tracking and train a CNN model on these images for subsequent validation.

- **Remote Object Validation:** Employ the trained CNN model to validate objects in a remote space, extending the project's utility beyond local tracking.

- **Customizable Configuration:** Easily configure YOLOv8 parameters, CNN training settings, and validation parameters according to specific project requirements.
