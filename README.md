# Object-Tracking-and-Validation-with-YOLOv8-and-CNN
This project combines real-time object tracking using YOLOv8 with the training of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the tracked objects. The pipeline involves persisting object tracks, saving cropped objects, training a CNN model, and utilizing the trained model for remote object validation.
